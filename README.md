# My Personal CV

Welcome to my personal online CV, a portfolio that showcases my skills and experience in an unusual way. This project is built using TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS, and it includes a visual map that displays my stack, a timeline of my life, and a fake chat powered by ChatGPT.

## Features

With my personal CV, users can:

- Get a general idea about myself, my way of thinking, creativity, and of course, the facts of my past.
- Explore my stack through a visual map that includes my main technologies (TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS) and other techs that have some connection to them.
- Navigate a timeline of my life that includes branches on both sides representing my schools or jobs. Users can click on each event to see more details, such as name, place, year, category, image (if available), description, and tech.
- Filter events by categories, such as education, school, job, IT, music, and private, to focus on specific areas of my life.
- Engage with a fake chat that simulates a conversation with ChatGPT. Users can ask questions about myself or my page and get automated answers.

## Architecture

This project follows best practices for structuring React apps. It includes components for the visual map, the timeline, the chat, and other UI elements, as well as data files in JSON format that hold settings, images, and text data for the CV and the whole page.

## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- React
- TailwindCSS

## Installation and Usage

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
3. Start the development server by running npm start.
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment

This project is currently hosted by webgo, but you can deploy it to any hosting service that supports React apps. To deploy it:

1. Build the project by running npm run build in the project directory.
2. Upload the build directory to your hosting service.
3. Make sure to set up the necessary environment variables and configuration files according to your hosting service's requirements.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to create a platform for users to generate their own CVs based on this project's code. This will require creating a set of forms where users can input and edit their data, as well as storing the data in a database and integrating it into the app's architecture.
